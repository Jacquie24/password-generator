# password-generator

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a random password generator utilizing JavaScript functions.  The page accepts input from the user regarding desired parameters for their desired password, after which time the program compiles these choices and generates a password for the user. 

## Usage
Once the initial webpage is loaded, the user must click on the button that reads "Generate Password." ![PasswordOpen](/images/password1.png)
Through a series of prompts, the user can input their desired length of password, and then they can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.  Once these choices are made, a random password is created and posted in the display window. ![PasswordComplete](./images/password2.png)
In order to start the process over, the user can once again click Generate Password.

## Installation

## Credits
I had a lot of help on this homework.  My classmate Pete Kriengsiri first set me on the right path with using strings.  I also spent a lot of time on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) going over JavaScript. Finally today, our fearless TA Peter Colella talked me out of using a while loop where an if statement would suffice.
